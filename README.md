# Laptop_Price_Prediction

I created an end-to-end well documented Machine learning project with a technical report which goes by : 'Laptop Price Prediction', wherein when we input the features of the laptop such as ram, processor, resolution etc., we get the output as 'the fair price' of the laptop. This project is based on a real world problem that I faced while buying a laptop, about what should be the appropriate price, given a laptop and its features.
As per industry standards, I divided and documented all of my phases of the project, starting from understanding the data, exploratory data analysis (EDA), Statistics and feature engineering, machine learning model building and got a whooping accuracy of 89%. I applied a pipeline based implementation and used all of my machine learning models. Below attached are the files in a sequential order which includes
1. Problem statement
2. Exploratory data analysis and data visualization (with explanation meant for educational purposes)
3. Machine Learning model with evaluation and accuracy
4. Report
